<h3>ROCS conformer selection and alignment</h3>

<p> ROCS gnerates pairwise overlays betwen conformers.  Given a set of
active compounds and a matrix of pairwise overlays between all
conformers how do we select the best consistent set of conformers?</p>

<p> A GA has been written to select a set of conformers (one for each
active structure).  The chromosome is a integer string with position
encoding structure number and value encoding conformer number. The
fitness score is the average shape tanimoto between all conformers in
the chromosome.  There exists the problem that the selected conformers
may not fit togeteher in 3D space.  In order to correct for this we
identify features in each conformer (currently we just use hetero
atoms).  Given three conformers (say A, B, C) we have three ROCS
overlays AB, BC and CA.  As a simple test we can penalize any
violations of the triangle inequality for inter-feature distances. All
distances for all structure triplets are evaluated and the
(normalized) square of distance violations subtracted from the chromosome
fitness.  </p>

<h3>Using the GA</h3>

<h4>Running Omega and ROCS</h4>

These <a href="omega2.parm">Omega</a> and <a href="rocs.parm">ROCS</a>
parameter files have been shown to create files consistent with the
file and structure name input that gape expects.


<h4>Preparing ROCS Input</h4>

<p>All sdf files output from ROCS searches should be put in a single
directory.  There shouldn't be any other sdf files in this directory.
Each ROCS file should have the query conformer at the second structure
and target alignments with shape tanimoto scores in subsequent
entries. Each possible combination of pairwise alignments should be
stored in the sdf files (i.e. configure ROCS to output all results and
not just the top matches)</p>

<p>This command parses the contents of the directory (all sdf files
with the string "hits_" in the filename) to create an index file for
all pairs (typically called "sdfparser.dat", though this can be
changed to track datasets).  Once you've run this you don't need to
run it again unless the ROCS results change</p>

<code>
&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;/sdfparser.sh &lt;ROCS_RESULTS_DIR&gt; &lt;INDEX_FILE_NAME&gt;
</code>
<p>

<h4>Running the GA</h4>

<code>
&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;/conformermatch.sh &lt;CONFIGURATION_FILE_NAME&gt; &lt;INDEX_FILE_NAME&gt;
</code>

<p> A example configuration file is <a
href="conformermatch.conf">conformermatch.conf</a>. The GA will report
it's progress in the file <i>ga.out</i>.  At the end for the file will
be the best solution from all GA runs.  The GA will also output a
bunch of sdf files for this solution.</p>

<h4>SDF files</h4>

<p> The output is best explained by example.  Suppose the GA picks
conformers GNF1_24, GNF2_37, Merck10_1, Norvatis_2, Merck4_18,
Merck13_3, IRM_5, Merck12_1, IRM-GNF 1_49, IRM-GNF2_40, ONO_37 and
Merck8_40.  The highest average pairwise similarity for this set
belongs to IRM_5. Using the ROCS results we can create 12 overlays for
this set- one using GNF1_23 as the query, one for GNF2_37 as the query
and so on.  We can use least squares fitting to orientate the overlays
to the overlay for IRM_5.  We then output all overlays as
"GNF1_24_overlap.sdf", "GNF2_37_overlap.sdf" and so on.

<p> We further extract the coordinates of GNF1_24 from all overlays
and write them to "all_GNF1_24.sdf" and do the same for all
conformers.  Finally we average the coordinates for each conformer
(for example we look at the coordinates for GNF1_24 in each of the 12
overlays and average those) and write them to
"average_molecules_sdfparser.sdf" (assuming the index file is named
"sdfparser.dat").  Finally, distant coordinates far from the average
that are distorting structues are removed to create consenus
coordinates which are saved in "consensus_molecules_sdfparser.sdf".  This final
file is the best representation of the overlap.  </p>

<p>
You can perform this analysis for any set of conformers using this command:
</p>

<code>
&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;/conformeroverlay.sh &lt;COMMA_SAPARATED_CONFOMER_NAMES&gt; &lt;INDEX_FILE_NAME&gt;
</code>

<p>
You can use copy and paste to grab a comma-separated list of conformer
names from the ga.out file to use in this command.
</p>
