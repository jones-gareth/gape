name = User Donors

# Weight- The feature score is scaled by this weight in the the
# chomosome fitness.  This should be a positive number for attractive
# features (features you want to superimpose) and negative for
# repulsive features.

weight = 1500

# Radius- the approximate radius of the feature gaussian (in angstrom).

radius = 1.5

# Atom_centered- the feature gausian is normally placed in the center
# of the feature.  Set this to have the gaussian centered on the first
# atom in the feature definition.

atom_centered = yes

#  Next comes the Feature section: each feature has a name, weight and
#  SLN definition.  Leave this line in - it tells GAPE that the
#  feature definition is starting.

START_FEATURES

#  Tabs separate fields

#  The sln patterns only support these attributes: f, !h, is= and
#  not=.  Z and Y act as Hev but must match the same elemental types,
#  additionally X != Y.

#  The weight is used to scale the gaussian overlays.  For two
#  features the maximum gaussian overlay is 1.0 (when the features are
#  on top of each other). The overlay score is scaled by the sum of
#  the weights.
