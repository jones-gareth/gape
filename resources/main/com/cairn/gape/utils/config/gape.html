      Note: these programs handle both MOL2 and SDF structure files.
      Wherever a reference to a MOL2 file appears you can normally
      substitute an SDF file.  Output files are normally in the same
      format as input files.

    <h2>Genetic Algorithm for Pharmacophore Elcuidation</h2>
    
    <a name="usage"></a> <h3>Usage</h3>
    
    <p><pre> java -server com.cairn.ga.Superposition &lt;configuration_file&gt; &lt;structure_files&gt;</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Overlays the structures in the &lt;structure_files&gt; and
      elucidates a pharmacophore.  The pharmacophore is comprised of
      features such as donor hydrogens, acceptor atoms and planar
      rings. 
    </p>
    <p>
      GAPE uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to align structures and a
      fitness score to optimize that alignment.  The fitness score
      includes terms for matchin features and common molecular volume.
      In a GA a set of encoded problem representations called
      chromosomes compete over time.  Hopefully, when the GA
      terminates the fittest chromosome is a good solution to the
      problem under investigation.  Since GAs are non-deterministic a
      GAPE job, or single program execution, consists of a number of
      GA runs that can then be sorted using the fitness of the best
      solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Program input consists of structure files containing the
      molecules you want to overlay and a configuration file.  The
      structure files may be Tripos mol2 or MDL sdf format. GAPE
      expects structures to include hydrogens and have groups which
      are normally charged at physiological pH ionized. However, GAPE
      can also be configured to fill valance with hydrogens and change
      common acids and bases.  GAPE will not attempt to overlay more
      than 7 structures- if you supply more than 7 structures only the
      first 7 will be processed.  The configuration file, <a
      href="superposition.conf">superpositon.conf</a> contains
      run-time settings and instructions.  You can use this file to
      re-parameterize the GA or the fitness function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Output consists of a log file, called <i>ga.out</i>.  Each GA
      run produces a mol2 file (or sdf file if the input structures
      are in sdf format) of aligned structures and elucidated
      parmacophore: <i>GA_1.mol2</i>, <i>GA_2.mol2</i>,
      <i>GA_3.mol2</i> etc.  These files are created as each of the
      runs finish.  On completion of all runs in the job, all the runs
      are sorted by GA fitness and output in ranked files:
      <i>GA_ranked_1.mol2</i>, <i>GA_ranked_2.mol2</i>,
      <i>GA_ranked_3.mol2</i> etc.  Thus <i>GA_ranked_1.mol2</i> is
      GAPEs best prediction.  The base molecule structure in these files
      also contains pharmacophore information in a MOL2 comment
      section (or SD field) which can be read by the <a
      href="#grips">GRIPS</a> program.
    </p>
    <p>
      By default GAPE will overlay donor hydrogens, acceptors, planar
      rings and moleuclar volumes. The user can define additional
      features.  An example feature definition file based on acceptors
      can be found <a href="example_user_features.txt">here</a>.
    </p>
    
    <a name="installation"></a> <h3>Installation</h3>

    <p>
      GAPE is a Java program, so you need to have Java installed.
      This section assumes that you are familar with setting
      environment variables and navigating your file system.  GAPE has
      been tested in a number of Java environments on Windows and
      Linux and the Sun SDK (J2SE version 1.5.0 or later) has the best
      performance (get it from <a
      href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The file <i>gape.jar</i> contains the Java bytecode for GAPE and
      associated utilities.  You need to add the full path to
      <i>gape.jar</i> to your CLASSPATH variable. (The configeditor
      and moleculeviewer us the Tonic look and feel so also add
      <i>toniclf</i> to CLASSPATH). On Windows the CLASSPATH vairable
      is a list of Jar files and directories separated by ';', on
      Linux and other UNIX systems the separator is ':' (if GAPE is
      the only Java program you run you won't need to worry about the
      separator).
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Java SDK is already installed on your system, then on
      Linux you're likely to find in under
      /usr/java/j2sdk&lt;version&gt;, on windows in
      c:\j2sdk&lt;version&gt;.  The Java program will be inside the
      bin directory: you should add this directory to your path if it hasn't
      been added already.  GAPE will also work with the Java Runtime
      (JRE), on Windows you'll find this in c:\Program
      Files\Java\j2re&lt;version&gt;. However, if you use JRE, the
      '-server' argument to Java won't work. Using the server VM
      (instead of the client VM, which is the default) results in a
      30% improvement in speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      GAPE makes use of JNI (native code) for faster maths operations
      and to get CPU timings.  The native code is in the library files
      <i>NativeUtils.dll</i> for Windows and <i>libNativeUtils.so</i>
      for Linux. The correct library for your system needs to be in a
      directory that Java will search for libraries.  For Windows this
      is any directory in the PATH environment variable, for
      Linux/UNIX it's any directory in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
      variable.  So you either need to copy the correct library to one
      of the directories in the enviroment variable or add the install
      directory to the environment variable.  For systems other than
      Linux or Windows (or if you run into library problems) both <a
      href=NativeUtils.c>NativeUtils.c</a> and <a
      href=NativeUtils.h>NativeUtils.h</a> are included here, so you
      can compile your own library. NativeUtils.c includes example
      compile commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're using Linux or Cygwin, you may wish to take advantage
      of the bash alias command: 
      </p>
    <pre>alias gape="java -server com.cairn.ga.Superposition"</pre>
    <p>
      There is an example setup file (<a href=bashrc>bashrc</a>) in
      the distribution directory.  This sets up the environment for a
      Linux machine and defines convenient aliases.
    </p>

    <a name="utilities"></a> <h3>Utilities</h3>

    <pre>java com.cairn.ga.ConfigEditor</pre>
    <p>
      Provides a graphical front end for editing configuration files.
    </p>
    <pre>java com.cairn.molecule.MoleculeUtils</pre>
    <p>
      Performs a number of useful transforms on structure files (for
      exmaple, add hydrogens, solvate or remove lone pairs)
    </p>
      <pre>java com.cairn.ga.PatternMatch</pre>
    <p>
      Searches an sln pattern against a mol2 file.
    </p> 
    <pre>java com.cairn.intranet.molecule.MolViewer</pre>
    <p>
        Takes mol2 or sdf files and displays them in a simple viewer.
    </p>
    
    <a name="examples"></a> <h3>Examples</h3>

    <p>
      The examples directory contains a mumber of examples!  Each test
      system has it's own sub-directory.  The examples range from
      trivial (metho_sf, benzodiazepine) to complex (dean_methyl2,
      5ht2a_2).
    </p>
    <p>
      Each example was processed using the command 
    </p>
    <pre>java -server com.cairn.ga.Superpositon ../superposition.conf test.mol2</pre>
    <p>
      Each test directory contains the input structures in
      <i>test.mol2</i> and the GAPE prediction in <i>GA ranked
      1.mol2</i>.  You can view the predictions using the viewer
      utility:
    </p>
    <pre>java com.cairn.intranet.molecule.MolViewer GA_ranked_1.mol2</pre>

    <a name="search"></a> <h3>Pharm Search</h3>

    <p>
      An additional program is available to screen a database of
      compounds against a rigid query.  This is equivalent to multiple
      GAPE runs, each of which compares the same rigid base molecule
      against a different flexible database molecule.  Once the last
      database molecule has been searched the GAPE target function can
      be used to rank database compounds against the query.
    </p>  

    <p><pre> java -server  -Xmx1024M com.cairn.ga.PharmSearch &lt;configuration_file&gt; &lt;structure_files&gt;</pre></p>

    <p>
      The first structure contained in &lt;structure_files&gt; is the
      rigid query, all the other structures are database compounds.
      Once the program is completed an ordered list of best target
      conformations is saved in <i>Matches.mol2</i>, while all GAPE
      overlays are contained in <i>All_Solutions.mol2</i> (or
      <i>Matches.sdf</i> and <i>All_Solutions.sdf</i>if SDF file
      format is used in the input files).
      </p>
    <p>
      An example is contained in <i>examples/pharm_5ht2a</i>.  The
      base molecule conformation was extracted from
      <i>examples/5ht2a_2/GA_ranked_1.mol2</i> and saved in
      <i>query.mol2</i>. Pharm search was performed using the command:
    </p>
    <pre>java -server com.cairn.ga.Superpositon pharm_search.conf query.mol2 all.mol2</pre>
    <p>
      <i>All.mol2</i> contains a number of 5ht2a actives.  <a
      href="pharm_search.conf">pharm_search.conf</a> contains the same
      parameters as <i>superposition.conf</i>, but is parameterised
      for fewer and faster GA runs.  You can view the predictions
      using the viewer utility:
    </p>
    <pre>java com.cairn.intranet.molecule.MolViewer Matches.mol2</pre>

    </p>

    <a name="grips"></a> <h3>GRIPS (GAPE RIgid Pharmacophore Search)</h3>
    
    <p><pre> java -server -Xmx1024M com.cairn.ga.RigidPharmSearch &lt;configuration_file&gt; &lt;query_file&gt; &lt;conformer_files&gt;</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      A third program matches a query against a conformer library (the
      conformer library can be gzipped).  Clique detection is used to
      match features in the query against conformers.  If at least
      three points match then the conformer can be fitted on the query
      and the overlay scored using the GAPE scoring function (using a
      feature match score and the volume overlay score).
    </p>

    <p>
      The configuration file contains special settings for GRIPS. An
      example is <a href="rigid_search.conf">here</a>.  The conformer
      files can be gzipped. Ordered hits are output in
      <i>Matches.sdf</i> (or <i>Matches.mol2</i> if MOL2 file format
      is used in the input files).
    </p>
    
    <h4>GRIPS Queries</h4>

    <p>
      Three types of query are avialable.  Firstly, you can use a
      single structure and not include any pharmacophore.  In this
      case all features in the single query structure are used.  To
      select this use the &lt;no_pharmacophore&gt; setting in the
      configuration file.  This option will also be chosen
      automatically if you only have one query structure and it has no
      pharmacophore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly you can use the results of a GAPE run as a query.  In
      this case the query features will be selected from the base
      molecule pharmacophore (you can change this by setting
      &lt;base_molecule_only&gt; to no- in this case pharmacophore
      features from all molecules in the overlay will be considered)
      and all molecules in the overlay contribute to the volume score.
      Obvoiusly, using these options you don't have to use the complet
      GAPE overlay as a query. You could extract just the base
      molecule (or another molecule from the overlay) and use it as a
      query.
    </p>
      Finally, the query can just include a pharmacophore (in a .pharm
      file).  It his case the soring function will only include a
      feature match term- the volume score will be 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can create pharmacophore queries from GAPE overlays.  Use
      this to extract the base molecule pharmacophore.
    </p>
    <pre>java com.cairn.ga.Pharmacophore -extract-base-only-pharm GA_ranked_1.mol2 ga.pharm</pre>
    <p>
      And use this to extract pharmacophore points for all molecules in the
      overlay.
    </p>
    <pre>java com.cairn.ga.Pharmacophore -extract-pharm GA_ranked_1.mol2 ga.pharm</pre>


    <h4>GRIPS Performance</h4>
    
    <p>
      Grips can spend much more time reading and preparing input
      structures than searching for matches.  There are some things
      that can be done to improve performance.  Firstly, it's best to
      solvate and add hydrogens before running GRIPS, rather than have
      GRIPS do this. So turn off these options in the configuration
      file.  Conformer libraries can be prepared using this command:
    </p>
      <pre>java com.cairn.molecule.MoleculeUtils prepare mols.sdf.gz mols_prepared.sdf.gz</pre>
    <p>
      Secondly, GRIPS will run a lot faster if in know that one
      structure is just a new conformer of the previous structure.
      This is implemented for the OpenEye conformer naming scheme
      (conformer names are like conformer_1, conformer_2 or
      conformer_1_rconf, conformer_2_rconf etc) using the
      &lt;openeye_conformers&gt; setting.
